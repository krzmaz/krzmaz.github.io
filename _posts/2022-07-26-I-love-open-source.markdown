# This is great! 
For some time now I've been thinking about creating a space where I could summarize various dives into more or less technical rabbit holes. Mostly for my future self, to have a reference when building new things based on the previously gathered knowledge. Maybe to share with some friends when discussing stuff.  
And if some stranger stumbles upon it and finds it useful that's a great addition, but definitely not the target 😀  
You know, just once to be on the other side of the scenario where you are working on some obscure problem and get unblocked by finding a blog post on it from five years ago.

With my limited skills in the frontend area, creating something that would be fairly pleasant to look at was a really daunting task. But today I decided to experiment with Github Pages and Jekyll templates. 

This blog uses [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) theme, linked all over the place.
With just a few edits and commands, I was able to see a fully fledged personal website come to life!

Now let's see what will I do with it...

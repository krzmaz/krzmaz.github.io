### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Krzysiek (or Chris for the **~99.5%** of people that cannot speak polish ðŸ˜€)  

In most places I paste my description as:
>C++ developer, embedded systems and IoT enthusiast.

Which basically sums up the stuff that you might be here for.

On a more personal note I'm into hiking, stand up paddling and photography.  
I'm setting myself an ambitious goal of using my own photos as cover images for blog posts.  
Which hopefully means I'll be motivated to go out and take more pictures if I run out of good cover photos...

Fun fact - my last name: "Mazur" refers to the [Mazury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazury) region in north Poland where I come from. The region is most known for its lakes, so expect a lot of water in photos on the blog.

If you want to contact me or find my other public profiles, you can use those nice icons in the page footer â˜Ÿ

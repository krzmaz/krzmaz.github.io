### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Krzysiek (or Chris for the **~99.5%** of people that cannot speak polish ðŸ˜€)  

In most places I paste my description as:
>C++ developer, embedded systems and IoT enthusiast.

Which is true.

On a more personal note I'm into hiking, stand up paddling and photography.  
I'm setting myself an ambitious goal of using my own photos as cover images for blog posts.  
Which hopefully means I'll be motivated to go out and take more pictures if I run out of good cover photos...
